## Course Policy

I will detail the policy for this course below. Basically, don't cheat and try to learn stuff. Don't be that guy.

### Grading Policy

- **25%** of your grade will be determined by Mid Semester Examination.

- **20%** of your grade will be determined by tutorials, assignments and quizzes.

- **15%** of your grade will be determined by a term project. Term project will include 05-page paper submission and a presentation. More information on term paper will be provided later in class.

- **40%** of your grade will be determined by a final exam.

### Attendance Policy

 There is no direct weightage given to attendance. However students are encourage to attained classes because there may be surprise tutorials, assignments and quizzes.

### Late Arrival of the Professor Policy

Dear students I am writing this to let you know what you should do if I am late to class. This seems like an anachronism. I will inform students via e-mail in advance of class if class is cancelled for the day. I will also contact to department and your class representative if something happened on the way to work. Failing that, assume the worst happened to me. I ask the students make sure that my story gets the proper treatment on an *Prime TV* show. I also ask that my story be narrated by Arnab or Ravish.

### E-mail Policy

I am usually quick to respond to student e-mails. However, student e-mails tend to do several things that try my patience. I have made a policy, that outlines why I will not respond to certain e-mails students send. Multiple rationales follow.

1. The student could answer his/her own inquiry by reading the syllabus/handout.
3. The student wants to know what topics s/he missed during a class s/he skipped. The answer is always "you missed what was on the syllabus."
4. The student is protesting a grade without reference to specific points of objection. See the policy on protesting a grade in the syllabus. These e-mails tend to be expressive utility on the part of the student and do not require a response from me. Students interested in improving their knowledge of material should see me during office hours or ask an appointment for video conferencing.
5. The students wants to know how many classes s/he missed at some point during the semester. I assume the student has a better answer to that question than me until the end of the semester.
6. The student is requesting an extension on an assignment for which the syllabus already established the deadline. The answer is always "no".
7. The student is *"grade grubbing"* or asking to round up a grade. The answer is always "no".
8. The student is asking for an extra credit opportunity, a request that amounts to more grading for the professor. The answer is "no".


### Make-Up Exam Policy

There are **NO** make-ups for missed exams unless backed by proper medical reasons. Otherwise Institute policies will be applicable.

### Academic Dishonesty Policy

Don't cheat. Don't be that guy. Yes, you. You know exactly what I'm talking about too.
