You are expected to collect information on an existing international airport (anywhere in the world except in India) regarding (but not limited to) its location, history, runway and terminal design, passenger demand, freight demand, and any other salient features. You need to submit a 2-3 page article, and deliver a 5 minute presentation to the class. Exact details will be discussed later.
